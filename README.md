<h1 align='center'>CrunchFlow</h1>

CrunchFlow is reactive transport software developed by Carl I. Steefel, Toshi Bandai, and Sergi Molins at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

# Installation
Do not use petsc-3.22 with CrunchFlow, since the newly developed PETSc Fortran hooks there do not work.  Use instead petsc-3.21 (https://web.cels.anl.gov/projects/petsc/download/release-snapshots/petsc-3.21.tar.gz).
